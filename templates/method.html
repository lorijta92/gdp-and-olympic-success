            The original data was downloaded as csv files from Kaggle and the World Bank, before being cleaned using 
            Python and relevant libraries such as Pandas, and pushed to a Postgres database using SQLAlchemy.<br>
            <br>
            The newly cleaned csv files were then taken and converted into a SQLite database for this project. SQLite was used 
            for a more efficient connection, rather than connecting directly to the Postgres database and remapping the tables. 
            After connecting to the database with SQLAlchemy, further cleaning was done using Python inside Jupyter Notebook to 
            format the data to the structure necessary for this analysis before returning the data as a JSON.</p>

                    We first wanted a larger overview of general country performance, <i class="font-italic">“Which countries score 
                    the most gold medals?”</i> To visualize this, a choropleth map was made using <code>Leaflet.js</code> and 
                    <code>geoJSON</code> to represent the percentage of gold medals won by each country out of all available gold 
                    medals each year. We focused on gold medals for this map because we thought it was most representative of 
                    Olympic success. We found that successful countries tend to be those with colder climates (such as Russia or 
                    Norway), suggesting that monetary wealth is not the only indicator of success. Future analysis would look into 
                    climate as well as elevation and compare performance each year of the games to the location of the games.

                After getting a sense of the general top performers in the Winter Olympics, a scatter plot was made to look at the 
                relationship between medals won, and GDP per capita. Using <code>chart.js</code>, markers were grouped by medal type 
                and colored appropriately, and the radius set to represent GDP. The expectation was to see larger circles higher up 
                the y-axis, which represented the total count of medals. However, the markers highest up the y-axis, were not the same 
                markers with the largest radii. This again signaled that GDP may not be as influential as initially assumed. Future 
                analyses would look for any shared attributes between highest performing countries and compare that to any shared 
                attributes between countries with higher GDP. <i class="font-italic">What do strong Olympic performing countries have in

                For a more granular view, a line graph was made using <code>plotly.js</code> to look at individual country 
                performance, analyzing the relationship between relative population size and percentage of medals won. A 
                country’s relative population size was calculated by dividing said country’s population over the sum population 
                of all countries that medaled in a given year. This means that only countries that won medals were taken into 
                consideration. If a country did not win any medals in a specified year, their population data was not used. The 
                assumption was that a country with more competing athletes would then also win more medals. Total world population 
                was not used as it was not the best representation of who competes in the Winter Olympics.<br>
                <br>
                Though no strong correlation was found between population and medals, there were some interesting trends. China 
                had a consistently high relative population (53-56%) and yet only won 1-3% of available medals. Norway on the other 
                hand, had a consistently low relative population (less than 1%) and yet performed at a consistently high level. Again, 
                pointing to the idea that perhaps climate is a stronger indicator of performance.</p>

            Our initial hypothesis was that there would be a meaningful connection between monetary wealth/population size and 
            the amount of medals won. However, our analysis shows that other factors (such as climate) are more likely to explain 
            performance. As the full database also contains information on the Summer Olympics, natural next steps would include 
            analyzing country performance in the summer games and then comparing the results of both games. <i class="font-italic">Are 
            there any countries that consistently perform well at both the summer and winter games? What are some notable attributes 
            of those countries? Are there shared attributes between top summer game performers and top winter game performers?</i></p>
